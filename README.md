<h3>Downloads and runs a minecraft server of your choice</h3>

Simply cd into the folder Automated-mc-server and run the command, "chmod +x (version).sh; sudo ./(version).sh"

After this is will ask you to agree to the eula, cd into the folder, "MC", open "eula.txt" in a text editor e.x vim, nano.<br>
Change eula=False to eula=True.<br>
(you may also want to change the seed, gamemode, render distance etc in server.properties)<br>

After you make any tweaks you want, "chmod +x run.sh; ./run.sh"
